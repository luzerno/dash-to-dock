# Dash to Dock Gnome Shell Extension
An extension for Gnome Shell that transforms the dash into an intellihide dock.

By default the Gnome Shell Dash is shown in the overview providing launchers for favourites and running aplications. This extension do move the dash out of the overview making it visible for easier launch of applications and faster switch between them without leaving the workspace view.
